# Purse web SDKs loader

A loader for injecting the [Purse's](https://docs.purse.tech/docs/integrate/purse-checkout/integration-mode) web scripts
and provide TypeScript types.

While the SDK can be imported through this package, the core Purse runtime is always loaded directly
from https://cdn.purse-sandbox.com to meet compliance and security requirements. This ensures that the global Purse
object behaves consistently across all environments without the need to self-host or bundle the script.

The `loadHeadlessCheckout` function dynamically retrieves the most up-to-date version of the Purse Web SDK, independent
of the version of `@purse-eu/web-sdk` in your project. Package updates focus on developer experience and do not alter
the runtime capabilities of the SDK itself.
